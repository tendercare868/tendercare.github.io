          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Many people want the same things as they get older: to stay in their
            own homes, to maintain independence for as long as possible and to
            turn to family and friends for help when needed. Staying in your own
            home as you get older is called “aging in place.” But many older
            adults and their families have concerns about safety, getting around
            or performing other daily activities. Living at home as you age
            requires careful consideration and planning. At Tender Care 868 we
            offer services to help you and your loved ones continue to live a
            happy and comfortably life.
            <br />
            <br />
            At Tender Care, we pride ourselves on delivering quality and
            competent care. Our team comprises of five registered nurses and two
            on call doctors. We use the data collected from the registration
            form you filled out to assess the level of care we can provide for
            your loved one.
